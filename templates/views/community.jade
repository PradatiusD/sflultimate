          These are the games that I pulled from the pick-up Ultimate site that I have heard are legit but I have never played:
          Key Biscayne Ultimate (Never been to this game)

          Phone: 561.247.2684
          Website: http://www.ratradio.net

          Sundays: 6:00 @ Mast Academy

          Fields: Turf or Grass, depending on which field
          Description: We've been playing at Key Biscayne and Virginia Key for over 10 years now, but we have been adding more and more people over the last few years. Most of our players are from Key Biscayne but we have a good amount who come from the mainland. We range in age from 16 to 60 (average late 20's) years old, mostly male. We are pretty liberal with the rules (ie. NO hold/stall count or bricks) but most violations are enforced one way or another.
