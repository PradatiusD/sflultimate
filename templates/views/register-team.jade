        p We are pumped to bring our first team beach ultimate tournament to South Florida.

        p Join us on Saturday March 7th, 2020 at beautiful Crandon Park in Miami for a 4-on-4 beach tournament. We are looking for 6-8 teams of a maximum 10 person roster for a one day tournament or round robin.  Depending on the number of teams we will either play a round robin or bracket and play 4-5 games.  The on-field gender ratio is 2:2 but can be changed if both captains agree prior to each point.

        p Tournament fee is $150 per team and we will provide standard tournament snacks (bagels, bananas, oranges, apples) and water. We will have at least 1 lined field and will try to cycle teams through so every team can play at least one game on the port-a-field. We will also have prizes for the winning team and most spirited team!
